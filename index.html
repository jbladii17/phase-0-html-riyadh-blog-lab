      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>'Once a mudbrick waystation', but the text was 'Known by local wags as the Dead Center of the Kingdom, Riyadh is considered the most straight-laced of the\n         Kingdom\'s big three cities. With many forms of entertainment banned, few sights of interest and a brutal climate,\n         
         Riyadh is a business-only destination if there ever was one, but it\'s also the best place in the Kingdom to watch the\n           continuing collision of tribal Wahhabi conservatism grappling with modern technology and Western influences, and\n            
        things have loosened up slightly under Crown Prince MBS\'s watch.\n

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Until the 16th century, Riyadh was known as "Hajr", an important city of central Arabia dating from at least the 3rd
               century CE (and probably older). In the Middle Ages, Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al-Yamamah, whose viceroys
                presided over most of central and eastern Arabia.

                <p>The city is divided into 15 municipal districts', but the text was 'With the decline in the fortunes and wealth of central Arabia after the 10th century, the name Al-Yamama gradually\n
                  disappeared, and Hajr became subsumed under the name "Najd", which had referred only to areas lying further west. The\n                    name Hajr also gave way to the name "Ar-Riyadh" (meaning "the gardens"), as the old city broke into several towns and\n                     farming estates.\n
